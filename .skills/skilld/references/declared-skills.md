# Declared Skills

Use `.skills/skilld.json` when a project needs Skills on explicit Agent targets.
Run `skilld sync` to install the declaration.
Run `skilld sync --check --json` to check without installing or fetching remote bytes.
Exit code `1` with success data means the declaration needs sync.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "my-project",
  "agents": ["codex", "claude-code", "opencode"],
  "mode": "symlink",
  "skills": {
    "write-human": {
      "source": "github:owner/repository/skills/write-human#commit:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
    },
    "local-review": { "source": "../skills/local-review" }
  },
  "requires": { "pr": ["write-human", "local-review"] }
}
```

Replace the example commit with the exact source commit.
Remote sources use verified hosted Artifact delivery.
Private sources need a skilld account and access through the skilld GitHub App.
There is no direct GitHub fallback.

Local sources resolve relative to the declaration file.
The source directory must match the declared Skill name.
Sync copies local bytes into the managed store.
After a local edit, run sync again.
Checks also detect local file permission changes, including executable bits.
Sync copies those permissions to every managed Agent target.
Symlink mode links each Agent target to that managed copy.

`requires` names each consumer and its required Skills.
Consumers can come from a separate Plugin.
Every required Skill must have a source in this declaration.
The existing lockfile records these requirements and each declaration's sources and targets.
Removal refuses a required Skill until its consumer declaration releases it through sync.

Sync prepares every source before changing Agent targets.
One transaction writes installed Skills, targets, requirements, and declarations.
Preparation failures and target conflicts leave existing targets unchanged.
Repeated sync uses installed bytes when a remote source still matches its exact commit.
Sync preserves installed Skills omitted from the declaration.
Remove those Skills explicitly after releasing their requirements.

Declarations in one store can share a Skill with the same source.
Local sources must resolve to the same directory.
Remote sources must use the same selector and exact commit.
Sync combines their Agent targets.
If declarations share an Agent target, they must use the same install mode.
Conflicting sources or modes fail before any installation changes.
Changing one declaration's targets preserves targets required by other declarations.
Use a distinct `name` for each declaration in a store.

Use `--manifest PATH` to select another declaration.
Use `--global` for global Agent targets.
Use `SKILLD_DATA_DIR` to select a separate managed store.
This setting does not change global Agent target paths.

Existing unmanaged targets block sync.
Use `--adopt` to take ownership of an unmanaged symlink with identical Skill bytes.
Different bytes, directories, and broken links still block sync.
Sync preserves the original source directory.

Use a CLI containing `sync` to read lockfiles with recorded requirements.
Older CLIs reject those fields.
Keep legacy v2 stores separate; sync does not migrate their lockfiles.

## Keep the skilld-maintained Skill current

Declare `skilld` alongside the Skills that its CLI installs.
Use `github:skilld-dev/skilld/skills/skilld#commit:SHA` with the exact repository commit.
Replace `SHA` with the full commit hash.
Use the same declaration and store for later refreshes.
A CLI upgrade does not update installed Skill instructions.

Before migration, inspect existing Agent targets and their source directories.
If an unmanaged target differs, preserve it in a backup before replacing it.
Do not use `--adopt` to overwrite different bytes or directories.
Keep the legacy lockfile and its source files intact.

## Check before Agent startup

Run `skilld sync --check --json` before loading declared Skill instructions.
Pass the same manifest, scope, and `SKILLD_DATA_DIR` used during installation.
Only exit code `0` permits startup.
Exit code `1` means the declaration differs from its installation.
Other failures also block startup. Report the error instead of loading stale instructions.
If the declaration differs, run sync explicitly before starting the Agent again.
The startup check never installs Skills or fetches remote bytes.

## Account login from an Agent

Run `skilld auth login --no-browser --plain`.
The CLI prints an authorization URL and waits for its loopback callback.
Open that URL in the intended signed-in browser.
The CLI stores the resulting credential through its normal credential store.
Never copy browser cookies or tokens into a declaration.
